# Peer Message

Fast peer to peer messaging through WebRTC with automatic reconnect.

## Problem

Sending data between clients on the web is inherently slow due to two reasons.

1. Data must travel from client -> server -> client. This means a longer round trip for your data and increased latency.

2. Data is sent using TCP, this favoures reliability over speed as packets must be delivered in the correct order.

## Solution

WebRTC is an open standard for sending information directly between clients. This technology supports video and voice but also arbitrary data. By utilising this we can acheive sub 80ms messaging between clients.

## Installation

`npm i peer-message`

## Usage Example

```ts
import { PeerMessage } from 'peer-message';

const peerMessage = new PeerMessage(...args);

peerMessage.on('data', data => {
  // handle data
});

peerMessage.on('connect', () => {
  peerMessage.send({ hello: 'world });
});

peerMessage.host();
```

## Documentation

### PeerMessage

Create a new instance of PeerMessage which accepts signaling config and optional iceConfig.

```ts
const peerMessage = new PeerMessage({
  iceConfig: [],
  signal: {
    send: data => {
      websocket.send(data);
    },
    receive: update => {
      websocket.onmessage(data => {
        update(data);
      });
    },
  },
});
```

### on

Listen for events.

Possible events are:

connect - Clients have successully established a connection  
disconnect - The connection between two clients was lost or closed  
data - Data was received from a remote client  
error - An error has occured

```ts
peerMessage.on('data', () => {});
```

### send

Send data to a remote client. Objects are stringified/parsed automatically.

```ts
peerMessage.send({ hello: 'world' });
```

### host

Host a channel

```ts
peerMessage.host();
```

### join

Connect to a host

```ts
peerMessage.join();
```

## Signaling

Signaling is needed in order for two peers to share how they should connect. Usually this is solved through a regular HTTP-based Web API (i.e., a REST service or WebSockets) where web applications can relay the necessary information before the peer connection is initiated.

PeerMessage makes signaling easy. You simply need to relay the information given and received. Here is an example of signaling using websockets.

```ts
const start = () => {
  const peerMessage = new PeerMessage({
    iceConfig: [],
    signal: {
      send: data => {
        websocket.send(data);
      },
      receive: update => {
        websocket.onmessage(data => {
          update(data);
        });
      },
    },
  });
};

websocket.onconnected(() => {
  start();
});
```

## IceConfig

Clients may not be able to connect directly if they are behind a NAT or when connecting over a mobile network such as 3/4G. You can read more detail on this here [https://bloggeek.me/webrtc-turn/](https://bloggeek.me/webrtc-turn/)

We provide a default config pointing to free stun servers hosted by google. However you should not rely on this for production.

```json
[
  { "urls": "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" },
  { "urls": "stun:global.stun.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp" }
]
```

Twilio provides a great network traversal service which can be used by WebRTC, here is an example of the twilio config being used with PeerMessage. [https://www.twilio.com/stun-turn](https://www.twilio.com/stun-turn)

```ts
const peerMessage = new PeerMessage({
  iceConfig: [
    {
      url: 'stun:global.stun.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp',
      urls: 'stun:global.stun.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp',
    },
    {
      url: 'turn:global.turn.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp',
      username:
        '9e4b5cd9b97055a182295750fcf27000a51fd167d43061f379a49002bc9d5ef5',
      urls: 'turn:global.turn.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp',
      credential: 'jf308/4r9+uPbeEYn+ho918XDlVWVWcdtWJ/Bd7R1eP=',
    },
    {
      url: 'turn:global.turn.twilio.com:3478?transport=tcp',
      username:
        '9e4b5cd9b97055a182295750fcf27000a51fd167d43061f379a49002bc9d5ef5',
      urls: 'turn:global.turn.twilio.com:3478?transport=tcp',
      credential: 'jf308/4r9+uPbeEYn+ho918XDlVWVWcdtWJ/Bd7R1eP=',
    },
    {
      url: 'turn:global.turn.twilio.com:443?transport=tcp',
      username:
        '9e4b5cd9b97055a182295750fcf27000a51fd167d43061f379a49002bc9d5ef5',
      urls: 'turn:global.turn.twilio.com:443?transport=tcp',
      credential: 'jf308/4r9+uPbeEYn+ho918XDlVWVWcdtWJ/Bd7R1eP=',
    },
  ],
});
```
